# BHS-QI-GMB
A repository of information and system dynamics models to support collaborative planning, implementation, and monitoring of <b>Bronx Healthy Start (BHS) Partnership</b> community programs and services. BHS is a federally-funded initiative to address disparities in materal and infant mortality in at risk communities of The Bronx.  

To promote an ethos of continual quality improvement (QI) in the BHS Partnership, faciliated monthly Group Model Building (GMB) sessions will be convened. GMB sessions will be guided by best practices in system dynamics (SD) modeling, a rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary field of systems science research. SD modeling adds value to more traditional health program QI and evalaution methods by engaging partnership members in a process of co-learning and co-creation of tools that can simulation complex integrated models of change and test interventions hypothesized to improve health system performance, patient outcomes, and population health.
