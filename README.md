# BHS-QI-GMB: Bronx Health Start QI via Group Model Building 
A repository of information and system dynamics models to support collaborative planning, implementation, and monitoring of <b>Bronx Healthy Start (BHS) Partnership</b> community programs and services. BHS is a federally-funded initiative to address disparities in materal and infant mortality in at risk communities of The Bronx.  

To promote an ethos of continual <b>Quality Improvement (QI)</b> in the BHS Partnership, faciliated monthly <b>Group Model Building (GMB)</b> sessions will be convened. GMB sessions will be guided by best practices in system dynamics (SD) modeling, a rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary field of systems science research. SD modeling adds value to more traditional health program QI and evalaution methods by engaging partnership members in a process of co-learning and co-creation of tools that can simulation complex integrated models of change and test interventions hypothesized to improve health system performance, patient outcomes, and population health.
